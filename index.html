			<p>This is a report on a voyage undertaken by Wenzel Marine‘s 1<sup>st</sup> year trainee Tobias Klose aboard the container vessel „YM Welcome“ between April 19 and April 22 2017. At Wenzel Marine all trainees are required to travel on board a seagoing vessel at least once during their vocational training to get first-hand experience. We at Wenzel Marine believe that it is of high importance for all our trainees – whether they train for an office job or for a technical position – to see the components we are dealing with in the environment they are used in. The following report was written by Tobias Klose and is published here as is without further editing.</p>

			<p><strong>April 19:</strong> I travelled with our forwarding/logistics company Amaro to the ship. Our trip started around 12 o’clock in Bremen and around 15 o’clock we finally arrived at the HHLA Container Terminal Tollerort. A shuttle service picked me up there and took me directly to the ship „YM Welcome“. On board of the ship I met the Chief Officer and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Officer. At the same time the police came on board, because they needed to check the crew‘s passports and the visa of the captain’s wife who also happend to be on board.
After everything was checked and found in order, one crew member showed me to my cabin and told me about the meal times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast: 07:00-08:30</li>
<li>Lunch: 12:00-13:00</li>
<li>Dinner: 17:00-19:00</li>
</ul>
<p>After I‘d spent a while in my cabin, I went upstairs to see the 2<sup>nd</sup> Officer who unfortunately was very busy at this moment and told me that I should come back in the evening around 6 pm.
So at 6 pm I went down to the first deck where he met me and gave me a safety briefing. I learned something about the different types of alarm and how to deal with them and he showed me the escape routes and the lifeboats. Then we went outside on the deck and he told me something about the ship, how it was built in the shipyard, how the ship will be loaded and how the container terminal knows which containers are unloaded in the port and where the emergency exits from the engine rooms are ending.
Finally he gave me a tour of the bridge. There you have a great overview because the bridge is app. 40m high.
After this little tour we sat together at the deck A, had a cup of coffee and talked a little while to get to know a bit better.

			<p><strong>April 20:</strong> The previous evening we had agreed that we would meet at 8 am to visit the engine room. Unfortunately there was a lot to do in the morning and we postponed the meeting to 1 pm.
At 1 pm there wasn’t so much trouble and we went to the engine room. Since the engine room is situated in the stern of the vessel and we had to walk about 150m below deck. This long way to the engine room was very interesting and a totally new area for me. The engine room interested me very much. It is very big and I was surprised how clean and well-structured it was.
A trainee gave me a tour of the engine room. He was 24 years old and came from India. He was very friendly and tried to explain everything as good as possible. Because of the loud noise and some special terms I couldn‘t understand all he said, but I tried to understand everything as well as I could. I believe I understood most of the engine room.
The young man took a lot of time for me and after three hours the tour of the engine room was finished.
After the tour the young man informed me that they were going to start the main engine in the evening and he asked me if I wanted to join them. I was very happy to get this chance and I was back in the engine room around 10 pm.
First they started all diesel generators and when they were all running, they started the main engine. It is an incredible feeling to stand right next to such an impressive main engine. It ran at 23 rpm and you could really feel how the pistons were running inide their liners up and down.

			<p><strong>April 21:</strong> At the 21<sup>st</sup> of April we spent the day just sailing through the North Sea at about 11 knots. That day I had some time to talk with the other crew members. They had many questions and we talked about family, leisure, work and about the homeland. They were interested in the lifestyle in Germany and which country is the best in Europe to buy cheap things.
Furthermore I used my spare time to write down all the impressions, answer all the questions and write my notes cleanly. </p>

			<p><strong>April 22:</strong> Early in the morning we stood outside the port of Rotterdam. We had to wait for our place at the ECT Delta Terminal and the vessel was refuelled. When we sailed into the Port I was permitted to be present on the bridge. It was quite interesting to see how such a large ship slowly entered the port. We were accompanied by 4 tug boats and it took around 2 hours to enter the port and reach the terminal.
A taxi was called to picked me up at the ship. After that I talked for a while to the captain‘s wife.
After the passport check I was allowed to leave the ship. I said goodbye to the crew and left the ship.
By taxi I drove to the main station and then everything worked as planned. By train I went to Germany without any problems.
